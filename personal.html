            <p class="personality7">Physical characteristics are defining traits or features of a person's body. They encompass any way you can describe the physical traits of a person or group of people based on what you can visually observe. The first thing you see when you
                look at someone could be their hair, clothes, nose, or figure. As it is rightly said, the physical characteristics of a person define their physical personality and it is very important to develop a physical personality. Developing your
                physical personality not only draws the attention of other people towards you but also, keeps you healthy. It makes you gain confidence and look good.

        <p class="sub9">Social development is about improving the well-being of every individual in society so they can reach their full potential. The success of a society is linked to the well-being of each and every citizen. Social development means investing in people.
            Social development is the change over time in an individual's understanding of, attitudes concerning, and behavior toward others; for example, a developmental change in how people behave with members of the other gender or their understanding
            of what friendship entails. Ultimately, we all have to live with different people in society. We have to interact and communicate with different people in society. It is very important to develop socially and build good relations with society.
            We cannot live without society as everyone needs some people for being accompanied and it is very important to have good behavior towards other people in the surrounding and environment.

            <p class="sub13">
                Spiritual personality development is the most important as it tells a person about their weakness and strength. Your Spiritual Personality takes the study of personality to its logical and important next step: helping you to make connections between the
                strengths and weaknesses of your personality and your pursuit of a relationship with God. Spiritual personality development is more important as it brings peace inside your soul and brings trust whenever there is any problem that you can’t
                solve. A spiritually developed person will have faith in an unknown authority and prevent him from losing hope.

            <h1 class="sub16">Emotional personality development</h1>
            <p class="sub17">Emotional development involves learning what feelings and emotions are, understanding how and why they occur, recognizing your own feelings and those of others, and developing effective ways of managing those feelings. A well-developed emotional
                person has a very good balance of emotions and avoids an overflow of emotions. Sometimes, an overflow of emotions makes a person an emotional fool with no intelligence. This development allows a person to have a good balance in emotional,
                happiness, anger, and expression levels. One should have a good balance between intelligence and emotions as both of them are interrelated. Emotional personality development involves- Balancing different emotions, Self-motivation, Self-awareness,and
                Mentoring the levels of emotions.
