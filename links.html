    <div class="Q">
        <h3 class="H">PAID INTERNSHIPS</h3>
        <P class="bhawna">Paid internships exist primarily in the private sector or in large organizations that have the money to pay students to learn while they work. Given a choice of paid or unpaid internship, paid internships are definitely the internships of choice</P>
    </div>
    <div class="Q1">
        <h3 class="H1">SUMMER INTENSHIPS</h3>
        <p class="bhawna1">“summer internships are typically the most popular because students have less academic requirements and more availability.” Summer internships typically run for eight to twelve weeks long and can be full or part-time. These short-term experiences
            provide a real insight into what it’s actually like working in a particular job or career field.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Q2">
        <h4 class="H2">EXTERNSHIP</h4>
        <P class="bhawna3">An externship is an educational program for giving students short experiences of actual industry work through a partnership between the school and the business. Known also as job shadowing or work shadowing, an externship is usually shorter than
            an internship, but they both could lead to an employment contract upon completion.
        </P>
    </div>
    <div class="Q3">
        <h4 class="H3">C0-OPERATIVE EDUCATION</h4>
        <P class="bhawna4">Another type of internship to choose from is a cooperative education program. A co-op is a three-way partnership between a student, an employer, and a college or university. The main difference between an internship and a co-op experience is the
            length of time. While internships generally last anywhere from a few weeks to several months, co-op’s normally last one or more years. Co-Ops allow students to gain valuable work experience while also earning college credits.

    <div class="Q4">
        <h4 class="H4">VIRTUAL INTERNSHIPS</h4>
        <P class="bhawna5">– A virtual internship, sometimes called a remote internship or an online internship, is an internship program which does not require physical presence to participate. A virtual internship may be perfect for jobs where all work is completed online,
            such as in IT or digital marketing jobs.

        </P>

    </div>
    <div class="Q5">
        <h4 class="H5">FIELD EXPERIENCE</h4>
        <P class="bhawna6"> Field experience is the chance given to take knowledge received in the classroom and apply it hands-on in the actual respective environment under supervision. It is not an internship, but similar, and some examples are when teachers need a certain
            number of hours before they can teach on their own or when pilots need a certain amount of supervised flying time before they can earn their full license.
        </P>

    </div>
    <div class="Q6">
        <h4 class="H6">FULL-TIME INTERNSHIPS</h4>
        <P class="bhawna7">A full-time internship is one where the intern works at or above the threshold for full-time employment, usually over 30 hours per week. Still, though this type of internship differs from a regular job.
