        <p class="space5"> Skill development has been considered one of the critical aspect for job creation in India. Most of your skills can transfer to new opportunities. If you are not skilled enough with a certain skill set, you will not be qualified for any of the
            available jobs.This can lead to unemployment.Acquiring a skill is an investment in one's life and future. It opens up all sorts of employment opportunities and helps to create a sense of fulfilment. It is important to understand that knowledge
            doesn’t guarantee skill, practice does. Theory knowledge can give an imaginative structure but only practical knowledge can give a real exposure. Books are sufficient to throw light through someone else thought process but if you need to create
            own empire student need to come out of their comfort zone and implement their knowledge into the real world. </p>
